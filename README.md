# SentinelProtect (AKA SenProt) Cryptography Library

## Introduction
SenProtect (SenProt) is an encryption library developed by SentinelSec Studios (SSC) for use with encrypting and obfuscating traffic sent across SSC's internal networks. The primary goal of SenProt is to provide an easy-to-use and highly secure method of encrypting data, whether it be in bulk or on a per-transaction basis.

SenProt is utilized in various internal systems, including bulk encryption listeners that encrypt traffic and pass it on to the destination, where it is decrypted. This ensures secure and seamless communication between different components of SSC's infrastructure.

## Features
- **Easy-to-use API:** SenProt is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing developers to quickly integrate encryption and decryption functionality into their applications with minimal effort.
- **Highly secure encryption:** SenProt uses state-of-the-art encryption algorithms to ensure that data remains secure during transmission and storage.
- **Bulk and per-transaction encryption:** SenProt supports both bulk and per-transaction encryption, allowing it to adapt to different use cases and application requirements.
- **Seamless integration with internal systems:** SenProt is built to work seamlessly with SentinelSec Studios' internal systems, such as bulk encryption listeners, to provide end-to-end encryption for data in transit.

## Getting Started
